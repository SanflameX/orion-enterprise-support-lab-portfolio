Performing initial setup:

   Trying to find home server...

   * Verifying that the local machine ORION-L-DC01, is a Directory Server. 
   Home Server = ORION-L-DC01

   * Connecting to directory service on server ORION-L-DC01.

   * Identified AD Forest. 
   Collecting AD specific global data 
   * Collecting site info.

   Calling ldap_search_init_page(hld,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=orion,DC=lab,LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE,(objectCategory=ntDSSiteSettings),.......
   The previous call succeeded 
   Iterating through the sites 
   Looking at base site object: CN=NTDS Site Settings,CN=Default-First-Site-Name,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=orion,DC=lab
   Getting ISTG and options for the site
   * Identifying all servers.
