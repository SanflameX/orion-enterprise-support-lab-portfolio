Directory Server Diagnosis


Performing initial setup:

   Trying to find home server...

   * Verifying that the local machine ORION-L-DC01, is a Directory Server. 
   Home Server = ORION-L-DC01

   * Connecting to directory service on server ORION-L-DC01.

   * Identified AD Forest. 
   Collecting AD specific global data 
   * Collecting site info.

   Calling ldap_search_init_page(hld,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=orion,DC=lab,LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE,(objectCategory=ntDSSiteSettings),.......
   The previous call succeeded 
   Iterating through the sites 
   Looking at base site object: CN=NTDS Site Settings,CN=Default-First-Site-Name,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=orion,DC=lab
   Getting ISTG and options for the site
   * Identifying all servers.

   Calling ldap_search_init_page(hld,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=orion,DC=lab,LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE,(objectClass=ntDSDsa),.......
   The previous call succeeded....
   The previous call succeeded
   Iterating through the list of servers 
   Getting information for the server CN=NTDS Settings,CN=ORION-L-DC01,CN=Servers,CN=Default-First-Site-Name,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=orion,DC=lab 
   objectGuid obtained
   InvocationID obtained
   dnsHostname obtained
   site info obtained
   All the info for the server collected
   * Identifying all NC cross-refs.

   * Found 1 DC(s). Testing 1 of them.

   Done gathering initial info.


Doing initial required tests

   
   Testing server: Default-First-Site-Name\ORION-L-DC01

      Starting test: Connectivity

         * Active Directory LDAP Services Check
         Determining IP4 connectivity 
         * Active Directory RPC Services Check
         ......................... ORION-L-DC01 passed test Connectivity
